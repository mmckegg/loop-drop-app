loop-grid-push
===

Ableton Push (v1) bindings for [loop-grid](https://github.com/mmckegg/loop-grid). The mapping follows how Launchpad works pretty closely. The only difference is the side buttons are mapped to the button group right on top of the pads.

## Controller Mapping

Trigger sounds using the **pads** on the Push hardware that corresponds to the interface grid that you have added chunks to.

### Beat Repeat

The top buttons on Push enable **beat repeat** mode as follows:
  
  - None (free play), 
  - 1
  - 2/3
  - 1/2
  - 1/3
  - 1/4
  - 1/6
  - 1/8

When beat repeat is enabled, **hold down** a trigger on the main grid, and it will be **continuously triggered** at the selected rate to the project tempo specified. This allows you to play in perfect time with the tempo.

### Store Loop

By default the last 2 bars of everything you play is being recorded. The top buttons control the current loop. Press the **RecLoop** button to start looping the events you just played.

### Clear / Flatten

When no transformations are currently active (no beat repeat held or active suppression), **Clr/Flat** clears the currently playing loop, otherwise it locks in the current transform.

### Undo / Redo

These buttons trigger undo or redo of stored loop on press.

### Beat Hold

Top button **BeatHold** will loop the currently playing beat at the rate specified by the Beat Repeat buttons (A-H) when held down. You can lock in the loop by pressing the Flatten button (2/view) at the same time.

### Suppress

Top button **Suppress** will suppress all current playback when held down. You can lock that in by pressing the **Clr/Flat** button at the same time.

### Select / Move

To select buttons, hold down top button **Select**, and press some buttons on the grid and release. You can now hold **Suppress** to mute the selected slots, or hold another button on the grid to move/offset the loop events. 

### Loop Length

Hold **Select** and press the **Undo/Halve** button to halve loop length or **Redo/Double** to double.
